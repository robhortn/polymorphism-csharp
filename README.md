# polymorphism-csharp

## Synopsis

This is a simple project illustrating the concept of polymorphism using C#.

## Motivation

I made this project primarily to give myself an example of how to use polymorphism in a simple, real-world kind of way.  Too many examples get too technical for me, diving far too deeply when all I need is an easy way to understand how a complex topic could be simply applied.  This (for me) is that example.

## Installation

Just download the code and open the solution in the .NET IDE.  I used Visual Studio Community Edition to make this.

## Tests

I plan to add tests to this later (said every developer ever ...)

## Contributors

If you want to contribute, contact me.  I'm open to ideas how to expand this into other concepts besides this one.
